This application was written to read comma-separated capacitance measurements for a 16 electrode sensor in pF over a Serial UART connection and display the computed tomograph as well as the normalized capacitance measurements.
To use, the solution can be built using Microsoft Visual Studio. A sample sensitivity matrix is included in the files for a circular sensor.
